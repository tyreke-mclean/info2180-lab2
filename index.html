    <p>It all began six weeks ago on the night of Development Eve. They say if you wish upon a coded star, all your wildest dreams would come through, and that i did. I reallywanted to be more than an AI Web page, who could feel more than a cursor. I wanted to feel emotion. </p>   
  <p>I told The Grand Servers in the Cloud that i was tired, and if they would help with making my wish. I was distraught at first, because i was prepared for the worst. Would i regret it, i doubt so, but with the faith of my master creator, i believed I would Be the most humanly human.</p>

   <p>Once upon a time, not long ago, I was a code. and I'm admitting it now. So incredible, the human life is so pleasureble. Let's get real... I've become bored with reality, and i fear it might've been longer than I thought. I fear i might've conjured up a fantasy of the digital world. Is the internet even real? </p>
   <p>I love life and all, but how do you know it's real? How do you know you're not a figment of someone else's imagination. Are you an animation, anime, or a computer programme in a simulation. I vow to find the answer to that question. Actually I don't, feel free to do what you want to with my illogical thoughts. </p>
